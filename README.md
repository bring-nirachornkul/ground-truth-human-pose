# DrawDotApp 
## Creating the Ground truth

The "DrawDotApp" class is a GUI application for drawing dots on an image. It is designed for the purpose of creating ground truth data for human pose estimation. The user can open an image file and click on the image to draw a dot, which will be displayed in green. The coordinates of the dot will be displayed in the GUI, and the user can undo previous dots by clicking the "Undo" button.

The application also includes an "Exit" button to close the program, and the "Undo" and "Exit" buttons have been arranged to stay together. The coordinate display has been moved to the top of these buttons. The final purpose of this program is to save the coordinates of the drawn dots into a CSV file, so that they can be compared with the coordinates generated by a human pose estimation model. The program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate the image, and the tkinter library to create the GUI.

Still working in the progress.

We will upload the code when we finished all the project.
